            Nightmare (now your nightmare comes to life)<br>
            <br>
            Dragged ya down below<br>
            Down to the devil's show<br>
            To be his guest forever (peace of mind is less than never)<br>
            Hate to twist your mind<br>
            But God ain't on your side<br>
            An old acquaintance severed (burn the world, your last endeavor)<br>
            <br>
            Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air<br>
            'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)<br>
            So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head<br>
            You're now a slave until the end of time here<br>
            (Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning, pull the trigger)<br>
            <br>
            You should have known the price of evil<br>
            And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah<br>
            Oh, it's your fucking nightmare<br>
            (While your nightmare comes to life)<br>
            <br>
            Can't wake up in sweat<br>
            'Cause it ain't over yet<br>
            Still dancing with your demons (victim of your own creation)<br>
            Beyond the will to fight<br>
            Where all that's wrong is right<br>
            Where hate don't need a reason (loathing self-assassination)<br>
            <br>
            You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight<br>
            And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)<br>
            So sedated as they medicate your brainv<br>
            And while you slowly go insane, they tell you<br>
            (Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications)<br>
            <br>
            You should have known the price of evil<br>
            And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah<br>
            No one to call, everybody to fear<br>
            Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah<br>
            Oh, it's your fucking nightmare<br>
            <br>
            Fight (fight) not to fail (fail), not to fall (fall)<br>
            Or you'll end up like the others<br>
            Die (die), die again (die), drenched in sin (sin)<br><br>
            With no respect for another<br>
            <br>
            Down (down), feel the fire (fire), feel the hate (hate)<br>
            Your pain is what we desire<br>
            Lost (lost), hit the wall (wall), watch you crawl (crawl)<br>
            Such a replaceable liar<br>
            <br>
            And I know you hear their voices (calling from above)<br>
            And I know they may seem real (these signals of love)<br>
            But our life's made up of choices (some without appeal)<br>
            They took for granted your soul and it's ours now to steal<br>
            <br>
            (As your nightmare comes to life)<br>
            <br>
            You should have known the price of evil<br><br>
            And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah<br>
            No one to call, everybody to fear<br>
            Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah<br>
            Oh, it's your fucking nightmare<br>

            She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak<br>
            I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks<br>
            I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap<br>
            I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black<br>
            <br>
            Hey, wait! I've got a new complaint!<br>
            Forever in debt to your priceless advice<br>

            Your advice<br>
            <br>
            Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet<br>
            Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath<br>
            Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left back<br>
            Throw down your umbilical noose<br>
            So I can climb right back<br>
            <br>
