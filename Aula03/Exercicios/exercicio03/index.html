    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>
        (I'll hold onto feeling until my final breath escapes)<br>
        (Gazing upon this world until it fades)<br><br>
        <br>
        Fall with me into the other night<br>
        We can go beyond the horizon again<br>
        Fall with me until we're out of time<br>
        Let the current swallow<br>
        <br>
        These whispers keep clawing<br>
        Your mind is dissolving light<br>
        Sink while you bathe in hallucination<br>
        <br>
        Accept this descent into the night<br>
        Releasing your grasp to induce separation, plunged into the shadows<br>
        Lost in sensation, we're free-falling down into the ever black<br>
        Can you feel it? These pins and needles!<br>
        <br>
        Trapped in sensation, see what you have found here<br>
        You fell into the dark<br>
        Fell into the dark<br>
        <br>
        Release your grip and face the tide, accepting this damnation<br>
        Relinquish flesh temptation of the body and soul<br>
        The ebb and the flow, nothing confessed<br>
        Put me to rest<br>
        <br>
        Azrael, guiding me beyond the veil<br>
        Obitual, free me from this mortal shell<br>
        <br>
        Enter into the darkest night, I will sink where I lie<br>
        Through the sands of time, through the angel's eye<br>
        <br>
        My final breath<br>
        Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
        Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
        <br>
        (Whispers are) clawing!<br>
        Your mind is dissolving light<br>
        Enter the void and fall with me (with me) (with me)<br>
        Fall with me (with me)<br>
        <br>
        Enter the void<br>
        Fall<br>
        <br>
        Release your grip and face the tide, accepting this damnation<br>
        Relinquish flesh temptation of the body and soul<br>
        The ebb and the flow, nothing confessed<br>
        Put me to rest<br>
        <br>
        Azrael, guiding me beyond the veil<br>
        Obitual, free me from this mortal shell<br>
        <br>
        Enter into the darkest night, I will sink where I lie<br>
        Through the sands of time, through the angel's eye<br>
        <br>
        My final breath<br>
        Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
        Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
        Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
        <br>
        Sink while you bathe in hallucination<br>
        <br>
        My final breath<br>
        Swallowed by the womb of death<br>
        As you pass through the fucking gate<br>
        Descending towards the end faster<br>
    </p>
